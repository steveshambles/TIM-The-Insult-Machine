# TIM-The-Insult-Machine
Generates almost unlimited disgusting insults. For windows and Linux with GUI.

The Insult Machine (TIM) V1.80-WL. 
For Windows and Linux. June 2019.
Updated December 2019.

Written in Python 3.67 on Windows 7 and Linux Mint 19.1.
by Steve Shambles.

TIM is childish, disgusting, not politically correct, 
sexist, possibly racist, and very funny to those with
a polluted mind.

TIM is the ultimate expression of my own self-loathing.

I know the code is bad in a lot of places, I'm still learning, slowly.
