# TIM-The-Insult-Machine V1.91-WL


For windows and Linux with GUI. 

Updated June 2020

Written in Python 3.72 on Windows 7 and Linux Mint 19.1.
By Steve Shambles.

TIM is purile, stupid, childish, disgusting, politically incorrect 

and very funny to those with a sick, twisted and polluted mind.

TIM is the ultimate expression of my own self-loathing.
