The Insult Machine (TIM) V1.90-WL. 
TIM is the ultimate expression of my own self-loathing.

For Windows and Linux.
Updated June 2020.

Written in Python 3.72 on Windows 7 and Linux Mint 19.1.
by Steve Shambles.

This program, all its files and source code are completely Free.
Though I retain the moral right to the copyright thereof.

This program is free of adverts, malware etc and is the full version.

If you use anything from TIM in your projects,
a mention and a link to my blog would be greatly appreciated.

One time nag:
-------------
If you find this free software fun or something, feel free
to make a small donation to the author to encourage more
free programs like this.
See drop-down menu.
That's the only nag you'll get.


Introduction:
-------------
TIM is childish, disgusting, not politically correct, 
sexist, possibly racist, and very bloody funny to those with
a polluted, damaged or sick mind.


How TIM Works:
--------------
The Insult Machine,(TIM from now on), works by simply combining
5 words drawn at random from 5 separate text files of carefully
selected words.

According to my calculations on the latest word lists,
this will give us a potential of over 26.9 billion insult 
combinations, and you could multiply that by the 11 different 
accents on offer I suppose? That's enough insults to last 
anyone a lifetime!

Word Lists
----------
The word list files are separate, and are in standard plain text
so that TIM users can join in the fun by adding their favourite
words or removing words that they do not want.
These lists can be found inside the "clean_insults" and 
the "rude_insults" folders.

Portable
--------- 
TIM can be run from anywhere, just copy the TIM folder from
my Dropbox to your hard  drive, or even run it from a USB
stick if you want, no install required.

Click your plum
------------------
To start the torrent of abuse, click on the plum coloured
“Insult” button.

Not all of the insults make sense, but a majority do.
Ironically though, some of the funniest insults 
make no sense at all!

The "Saved" button
-------------------
Every insult created is automatically appended to a text
file called,“saved_insults.txt” 
and saved in the current directory.
  
Click on the green “Saved” button to view it.

You can delete the saved_insults.txt file if you want to, and
TIM will just create a fresh one for you and start collecting
insults in it again.

Copy insult, (right click menu)
------------------------------
If you want to grab a certain insult directly from the listbox
to mail to your Mum or whatever, then click on the insult to
highlight it, and then right click the mouse, now select 
“copy To Clipboard” from the pop up menu.

The insult will be copied to your clipboard for pasting
anywhere you like.

Save As Fav (right click menu)
------------------------------
Also in the right click menu is, "Save as a Fav insult".  
This saves individual insults to yet another text file called 
"my_fav_insults.txt". Click the "Favs" button to view your
saved favourites.

Hear selected insult (right click menu)
---------------------------------------
Finally in the right click menu you have "Hear Selected Insult".
This will do as expected. Note that if you have "save Mp3"
ticked it will save the mp3, and if not ticked, it will not
save it.

Hear insult (check box, bottom left)
------------------------------------
By default, the generated insult just appears in the listbox.
If you tick the “hear insult” check box (bottom left of the GUI)
then TIM uses Google translate to convert the text to speech.

Save insult (check box)
-----------------------  
If you want to retain a copy of the mp3, just tick the 
“Save Mp3“ checkbox, bottom right of GUI.

MP3s button (orange)
--------------------
To view any MP3’s you have previously saved, click on the orange
“MP3s” button. Here you can double click on them to hear again
or delete\copy them, the world is your sexy oyster here.

Clear button (yellow)
---------------------
You can clear the list of insults from the listbox at any time
with the yellow “Clear” button.

Accents (Accents menu)
----------------------
There are 12 different accents to choose from.
Choose one, and then give it a few seconds to 
contact Google translate.
Simple really, isn't it.

Internet connection required
-----------------------------
Obviously an internet connection is required to access Google
Translate and hear the insults.

If it doesn't work, maybe your Firewall is blocking TIM,
or possibly the free requests per month have been used up
by TIM users. 

The requests are counted from ALL users of TIM, so if TIM gets
popular this service may not work all the time.
However you can still generate insults withthe sound off.

In the future Google may change how the service works or stop 
it being free, ths might cause TIM to be speechless.
Check for updates on my blog or on Github for updates
if this happens. See menu for links to these.

Clean insults (Insults menu)
----------------------------
For those of a more sensitive nature, V1.52 onward has a
simple menu option to select either "clean insults" or
"rude insults". By default TIM starts with clean insults.

Rude insults (Insults menu)
----------------------------
Warning, selecting this option is dynamite and extremly 
offensive to nearly everyone.

Use these insults at your own discretion and don't
come crying to me if your feelings, morals or 
sensitivities get hurt, as you have been warned many times.
Imagine the worst insuls ever and then multiply that by 100
and you may get an idea of the naughtiness levels used here.

-----------------------------
That's all you need to know really, have a beer,
start smoking again and have a laugh with 
your mates and TIM.

Note:
The "humour" TIM uses is mainly British based, so some 
non-Brit's may not 'get it" for some insults I suppose.

But if it's to complain about being upset about the words used, 
then don't expect a reply OK!

TIM was written just for fun, and for programming practice, 
I'm still a Python programming noob.
